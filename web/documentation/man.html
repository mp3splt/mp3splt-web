mp3splt, oggsplt, flacsplt - utility for mp3, ogg vorbis and native flac splitting without decoding
<A NAME="lbAC">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2>

<P>

<B>mp3splt [OPTIONS] FILE_OR_DIR1 [FILE_OR_DIR2] ... [BEGIN_TIME] [TIME2] ... [END_TIME]</B>
<P>

<B>FILE_OR_DIR</B>: mp3, ogg vorbis, native flac file to be split or a directory.
If you want to specify STDIN as input, you can use &quot;m-&quot; (or &quot;-&quot;)
when input is mp3, and &quot;o-&quot; when ogg. Multiple files can be specified, all files will be split
with the same criterion. If a directory is specified, a recursive scan is performed in that
directory to find out all the supported file formats.
<P>
<P>

<B>TIME FORMAT</B>:
<P>

<B>minutes.seconds[.hundredths]</B> or <B>EOF-minutes.seconds[.hundredths]</B>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><DD>
<B>Minutes</B> (required): There is no limit to minutes. (You must use this format also for minutes over 59)
<DT><DD>
<B>Seconds</B> (required): Must be between 0 and 59.
<DT><DD>
<B>Hundredths</B>  (optional): Must be between 0 and 99. Use them for higher precision.
<P>
</DL>
<P>

Multiple split points can be specified. After the minimal 2, another indefinite number of split points can
be specified. Each split point will be an end time for the previous, and a begin for the following.
If you want to reach the end of file, you can use &quot;EOF&quot; as last splitpoint.
EOF-minutes.seconds[.hundredths] only works when input is seekable.

<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<P>

<B>mp3splt</B> is a free command-line utility that allows you to
split mp3, ogg vorbis and native flac files from several splitpoints,
without need of decoding and reencoding.
It is useful to split large mp3, ogg vorbis and native flac to make smaller files or to split
entire albums to obtain original tracks.
<P>
If you are splitting an album you can get splitpoints and filenames
automatically from servers on internet like freedb.org, tracktype.org
or from a local .XMCD (.CDDB) or .CUE file (see -c option), with the possibility to adjust them automatically with silence
detection (see -a option).
<P>
You can also try to split files automatically with silence detection (see -s option),
trim files using silence detection (see -r option), or by a fixed time length (see -t option)
<P>
Or if you have a file created either with Mp3Wrap or AlbumWrap, you can easily split it
just with one command (see -w option).
<P>

<P>
<B>IMPORTANT NOTE for FLAC:</B> FLAC support is still experimental. Please use with caution. Missing
FLAC features are stdin (input not seekable) and stdout.
<P>
<B>NOTE for MP3:</B> usually mp3splt understands if mp3 is VBR by checking the presence
of a Xing or Info header and will consequently start in framemode, but if this is not present,
mp3splt will start in standard mode.
This means that splitting process will be quicker, but imprecise due to variable bitrate,
you can split those VBR files only with framemode (see -f option).
<P>
<B>NOTE for OGG:</B> in some cases, mp3splt does not manage to split
ogg vorbis streams correctly. Splitting the input file from 0.0 to EOF
might fix the issues.
<P>
<B>NOTES about TAGS:</B> by default, mp3splt will put the original tags in
the split files with one exception: the track number starts at 1 and is incremented along
split files. When copying the original file tags, only one artist, album, title are supported.
Custom tags for the split files can be set with the -g option.
Setting exactly the same tags as the original file is possible with -g %[@O] (mp3 only) or -g %[@o].
<P>
<B>NOTE about MP3 TAGS:</B> in order to extract the original tags from mp3 files,
libmp3splt must be compiled with 'id3tag' support. By default, the output
files will have the same ID3 tag version as the input file; this behaviour can be changed
with the -T option. If the input file has no tags and the -g option is used, then both
ID3v1 and ID3v2 are written. Total tracknumber is not yet supported.
Only writing ID3v2.4 is supported for custom tags; note that some software only support ID3v2.3
and will not be able to read them. However, it is possible to write the exact original tags using
%[@O], keeping the same tags version as in the original file.
<P>
<B>NOTE about the OUTPUT DIRECTORY:</B> by default, mp3splt will put the
split files in the directory of the input file. In order to change the
output directory, you can use one of the following options: -d or -o.
Please note that directories from the -o option will be created relative
to the input file directory.

<H2>OPTIONS</H2>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>-w</B>         <DD>
<B>Wrap Mode</B>. Use to split file created with:
<P>
<B>Mp3Wrap <A HREF="http://mp3wrap.sourceforge.net">http://mp3wrap.sourceforge.net</A></B>: This tool joins two or more mp3 files in one large playable file that usually contains
the string MP3WRAP in filename and a special comment in ID3v2. If the file you are splitting is a Mp3Wrap file
the splitting process will be very fast and you will obtain all files just with one command.
If your filename contains MP3WRAP and you have errors or you don't want to use
wrap mode, just remove it from the file.
<P>
<B>AlbumWrap</B>: mp3splt is compatible also with albumwrap files, which usually
contain the string ALBW in filename and ID3v2 contains AlbumWrap.
But, as AlbumWrap extractor, mp3splt doesn't give any warranty.
<P>
<DT><B>-l</B>         <DD>
<B>List mode</B> (Only for Wrap mode).
Lists all tracks wrapped in a Mp3Wrap or AlbumWrap archive without any extraction.
Use this to view the content of the file or to test if file is a valid wrapped file.
<P>
<DT><B>-e</B>         <DD>
<B>Error mode</B> (mp3 only).
It is useful to split large file derivated from a concatenation of smaller files. It detects split points
from the so called &quot;sync errors&quot; (data that break stream, such as ID3 or junk data).
Examples of applicable files are wrapped file (both AlbumWrap and Mp3Wrap) or file created by
appending many mp3 files together.
So, when you have a file to split, you should always try to use this option.
<P>
<DT><B>-A AUDACITY_FILE </B>         <DD>
<B>Audacity labels mode</B>.
Split with splitpoints from the audacity labels file. Example of audacity
labels file (in seconds):
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10.000000&nbsp;67.000000&nbsp;first_file
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;67.000000&nbsp;127.000000&nbsp;second_file
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;149.000000&nbsp;&nbsp;206.000000&nbsp;third_file
<P>
<DT><B>-t TIME[&gt;MIN_TIME]</B>         <DD>
<B>Time mode</B>.
This option will create an indefinite number of smaller files with a fixed time length specified by TIME (which has the same format
described above). It is useful to split long files into smaller (for example with the time length of a CD). Adjust option (-a)
can be used to adjust splitpoints with silence detection. &gt;MIN_TIME can be used to specify the
theoretical minimum track length of the last segment; it allows avoiding to create very small files
as the last segment. Make sure to quote the argument when using MIN_TIME - &quot;TIME&gt;MIN_TIME&quot;.
<P>
<DT><B>-S SPLIT_NUMBER</B>         <DD>
<B>Equal time tracks mode</B>.
Split in SPLIT_NUMBER files.
<P>
<DT><B>-r</B>         <DD>
<B>Trim using silence detection</B>,
to trim using silence detection. To trim using silence detection we need to decode
files, so this option can be really slow if used with big files.
It accepts some parameters with -p option (see below for a detailed description):
<I>threshold</I>

level (th) which is the sound level to be considered silence,
<I>min</I>

(min) which is the minimum silence length to trigger a trimming; this amount of silence will be kept
in the split file at the beginning and at the end.
<P>
<DT><B>-s</B>         <DD>
<B>Silence mode</B>,
to split with silence detection. When you use -s option, mp3splt attempts to detect
silence points in all the file (or just in some parts, see -a and -c below for this). To detect silence we need to decode
files, so this option can be really slow if used with big files.
It accepts some parameters with -p option (see below for a detailed description):
<I>threshold</I>

level (th) which is the sound level to be considered silence,
<I>number</I>

of tracks (nt) which is the desired number of tracks, cutpoint
<I>offset</I>

(off) which is the offset of cutpoint in silence,
<I>minimum_length</I>

(min) which is the minimum silence length in seconds,
<I>remove</I>

silence (rm) which allows you to remove the silence between split tracks. If you don't specify any parameter,
mp3splt will use the default values. Of course if you specify the number of tracks to split,
you will help mp3splt to understand what are the most probable split points,
anyway once you scan a file with -s option, mp3splt will write a file named &quot;mp3splt.log&quot; in which
it saves all silence points found. If this file exists in the current working directory, mp3splt
will read the splitpoints from this file and will not recompute the silence splitpoints.
This allows you to run mp3splt with different parameters (except th and min)
without decoding the file again. Finally, if the number of silence points is
not correct, you have many chances to achieve right result. For example if a silence point
was not detected because too short, you can manually split the long track in the two smaller ones.
Or if file is an MP3 (not with ogg) and there are too many silence points that can't be discarded reducing
track number (because are longer than right points) you can safely concatenate
them with 'cat' programs or similar ('copy /b file1+file2' for dos) because split files are consecutive,
no data is lost.
This option is intended to split small/medium size (but even large if you can wait ;)  mp3 and ogg files
where tracks are separated by a reasonable silence time. To try to split mixed albums or files
with consecutive tracks (such as live performances) might be only a waste of time.
<P>
<B>Note about &quot;mp3splt.log&quot;:</B> 
<P>
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;The&nbsp;first&nbsp;line&nbsp;contains&nbsp;the&nbsp;name&nbsp;of&nbsp;the&nbsp;split&nbsp;file
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;The&nbsp;second&nbsp;line&nbsp;contains&nbsp;the&nbsp;threshold&nbsp;and&nbsp;the&nbsp;minimum&nbsp;silence&nbsp;length
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;The&nbsp;next&nbsp;lines&nbsp;contain&nbsp;each&nbsp;one&nbsp;three&nbsp;columns:
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-the&nbsp;first&nbsp;column&nbsp;is&nbsp;the&nbsp;start&nbsp;position&nbsp;of&nbsp;the&nbsp;found&nbsp;silence&nbsp;(in&nbsp;seconds.fractions)
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-the&nbsp;second&nbsp;column&nbsp;is&nbsp;the&nbsp;end&nbsp;position&nbsp;of&nbsp;the&nbsp;found&nbsp;silence&nbsp;(in&nbsp;seconds.fractions)
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-the&nbsp;third&nbsp;column&nbsp;is&nbsp;the&nbsp;order&nbsp;of&nbsp;magnitude&nbsp;of&nbsp;the&nbsp;silence&nbsp;length;&nbsp;it&nbsp;is&nbsp;useful&nbsp;to&nbsp;find&nbsp;out&nbsp;most&nbsp;probable&nbsp;silence&nbsp;points
<P>
<DT><B>-c SOURCE</B>         <DD>
<B>CDDB mode</B>. To get splitpoints and filenames automatically from SOURCE, that is the name
of a &quot;.CUE&quot; file (note that it must end with &quot;.cue&quot;, otherwise it will be wrongly
interpreted as a cddb file) or a local .XMCD (.CDDB) file on your hard disk.
<P>
Furthermore, if you want to split using internal sheets, SOURCE must be <B>internal_sheet</B>.
Currently two internal sheets are supported: internal CUE sheet of native FLAC files and ID3v2
chapters for MP3 files (note that there is a limitation on ID3v2 chapters for overlapped chapters).
<P>
If you want to get informations from Internet, SOURCE must have one of the
following formats:
<P>
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>query</B>
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>query{album}</B>
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>query{album}(ALBUM_RESULT_NUMBER)</B>
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>query[search=protocol://SITE:PORT,&nbsp;get=protocol://SITE:PORT]</B>
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>query[search...]{album}</B>
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>query[search...]{album}(ALBUM_RESULT_NUMBER)</B>
<P>
If a string is specified between '{' and '}', then the internet search is
made on this string and the user will not be requested to
interactively input a search string.
The number between '(' and ')' is for auto-selecting the result number
ALBUM_RESULT_NUMBER; thus, the user will not be requested to interactively
input a result number.
<P>
The other parameters between '[' and ']' are used to specify the protocols
and the sites. If those parameters are not specified, default values will
be chosen, which are good enough in most cases.
Inside the square brackets, 'search' defines the CDDB search protocol and site (for
searching the disc ID from the album and title); 'get' defines the CDDB download protocol
and site (for downloading the CDDB file from the disc ID). Valid 'search' protocols are
: 'cddb_cgi' and 'cddb_protocol'.  Valid 'get' protocols are: 'cddb_cgi'.
<P>
Examples:
<P>
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;query[search=cddb_cgi://tracktype.org/~cddb/cddb.cgi:80,get=cddb_cgi://tracktype.org/~cddb/cddb.cgi:80]
<BR>

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;query[get=cddb_protocol://freedb.org:8880]
<BR>

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;query[get=cddb_cgi://freedb.org/~cddb/cddb.cgi:80]
<P>
Mp3splt will connect to the server and start to find the requested
informations. If the right album is found, then mp3splt will query the
server to get the selected album and (if no problem occurs) will
write a file named &quot;query.cddb&quot; from which will get splitpoints and
filenames.
<P>
<B>Proxy support:</B>
The first time that the user queries the internet (and if the quiet mode is not enabled), mp3splt asks
for some information about proxy usage. Mp3splt has basic authentification support using base64 for HTTP
proxies. A file named '.mp3splt' is created in the user home directory containing the informations
provided by the user. Deleting this file will make mp3splt to query the user again. Please note that
the authentification storage is not secure. The 'username:password' is stored as base64 and can be
easily decoded.
<P>
<B>IMPORTANT NOTE FOR CDDB</B>: File split with this option can be not very precise due to:
<P>
1) Who extracts CD tracks may use &quot;Remove silence&quot; option. This means
that the large file is shorter than CD Total time. Never use this option.
<BR>

2) Who burns CD may add extra pause seconds between tracks. Never do it.
<BR>

3) Encoders may add some padding frames so that file is longer than CD.
<BR>

4) There are several entries of the same cd on CDDB. In mp3splt they appears with &quot;\=&gt;&quot; symbol.
Try some of them and find the best for yours; usually you can find the correct splitpoints, so good luck!
<P>
<B>YOU CAN USE THE -a OPTION TO ADJUST SPLITPOINTS!</B>
<P>
<DT><B>-a</B>         <DD>
<B>Auto-adjust mode</B>.
This option uses silence detection to auto-adjust splitpoints. It can be used
in standard mode, or with -t and -c option (of course if there is silence in the file ;).
It accepts some parameters with -p option (see below for a detailed description):
<I>threshold</I>

level (th) which is the sound level to be considered silence, cutpoint
<I>offset</I>

(off) which is the offset of cutpoint in silence,
<I>min</I>

(min) which is the minimum silence length in seconds,
<I>gap</I>

(gap) which is the gap value around splitpoint to search for silence.
If you don't specify any parameter, mp3splt will use the default values.
With -a option splitting process is the same, but for each splitpoint mp3splt will decode
some time (gap) before and some after to find silence and adjust splitpoints.
<P>
<DT><B>-p PARAMETERS</B>         <DD>
<B>Parameters for -a, -s and -r option</B>. When using -a, -s and -r option some users parameters can be specified in
the argument and must be in the form:
<P>
<B>&lt;name1=value,name2=value,..&gt;</B>
<P>
You can specify an indefinite number of them, with no spaces and separated by comma. Available parameters are:
<P>
<DT><B>For -s, -a and -r</B><DD>
<P>
<DT><B>th=FLOAT</B><DD>
Threshold level (dB) to be considered silence. It is a float number
between -96 and 0. Default is -48 dB, which is a value found by tests and should be good in most
cases.
<P>
<DT><B>shots=INTEGER</B><DD>
Positive integer of  the minimum number of shots to be found as non silence
after the silence. Default is 25. Decrease this value if you need to split files having
closer silence points.
<P>
<DT><B>min=FLOAT</B><DD>
Positive float of the minimum number of seconds to be considered as valid silence. All silences shorter than min are discarded. Default is 0.
For the trim silence split, it is the minimum silence length to trigger a trimming; this amount of
silence will be kept in the split file at the beginning and at the end.
<P>
<DT><B>Both -s and -a</B><DD>
<P>
<DT><B>off=FLOAT</B><DD>
Float number between -2 and 2 and allows
you to adjust the offset of cutpoint in silence time. 0 is the begin of silence, and 1 the end. Default is 0.8.
In most cases, you will only need to use a value between 0 and 1.
<P>
<P>
<DT><B>Only -s</B><DD>
<P>
<DT><B>nt=INTEGER</B><DD>
Positive integer number of tracks to be split when using -s option. By default all tracks are split.
<DT><B>rm[=FLOAT_FLOAT]</B><DD>
It is used to remove silence when using the -s option.
Can be used without additional numbers - by default it will cut all the silence found.
Users can keep some of the silence found by passing the number of seconds to be kept at the
beginning of the output files and at the end of the output files. For example, 'rm=2_6' will keep 2
seconds of silence at the beginning of the split files and 6 seconds at the end.
If the silence length is less than the sum of the number of seconds passed to the rm parameter,
the split will convert the values to a percentage of the silence length. Taking the previous example, if
the silence length is less than 8 seconds, the split will be done at 75% of the silence segment starting from
the beginning of the silence ( 75% = 6/(2+6) ).
<DT><B>trackmin=FLOAT</B><DD>
Positive float of the minimum number of seconds for a track to be written out.
Tracks shorter than trackmin will be skipped during the output phase.
The default value 0.0 means to not skip any tracks.
<DT><B>trackjoin=FLOAT</B><DD>
Positive float of the minimum number of seconds for a track to be written out.
Tracks shorter than trackjoin will be joined with others. The main difference between this parameter
and trackmin is that using this one, no part of the original file will be lost.
The default value of 0.0 means to not join any tracks.
If using both trackmin and trackjoin, tracks shorter than trackmin will be discarded, but after the
join.
<P>
<DT><B>Only -a</B><DD>
<P>
<DT><B>gap=INTEGER</B><DD>
Positive integer for the time to decode before and after splitpoint, increase if splitpoints
are completely wrong, or decrease if wrong for only few seconds. Of course the smaller the gap, the faster the process.
Default gap is 30 seconds (so for each song, total decode time is one minute).
<P>
<DT><B>warn_if_no_aa</B><DD>
Print a warning for each splitpoint if it has not been auto-adjusted.
<P>
<DT><B>error_if_no_aa</B><DD>
Stop the split process with error if one of the splitpoints has not been auto-adjusted.
<P>
<DT><B>-f</B>         <DD>
<B>Frame mode (mp3 only)</B>. Process all frames, seeking split positions by counting frames and not
with bitrate guessing. In this mode you have higher precision and you can
split variable bitrate (VBR) mp3.
(You can also split costant bitrate mp3, but it will take more time). Note also that &quot;high&quot; precision
means that time seeking is reliable, but may not coincide for example with another player program
that uses time seeking with bitrate guessing, so make your choice.
Frame mode will print extra info on split process, such as sync errors.
If you obtain some sync errors, try also to split with -e option.
<P>
<DT><B>-k</B>         <DD>
<B>Input not seekable</B>. Consider input not seekable (default when using STDIN as input).
This allows you to split mp3 streams which can be read only one time and can't be
seeked. Both framemode and standard mode are available, but framemode can be really slow if used with big
files, because to seek splitpoints we need to process all bytes and all frames. -k option
(so STDIN as input too) can't be used together with -s -a -w -e, because input must be seekable for
those options. Copying original tags is not yet supported for the non seekable option.
<P>
<DT><B>-M</B>         <DD>
<B>Write MD5 sum (FLAC only)</B>. Using this option, the frames are decoded just before being written in
the output files and MD5 sum of the unencoded data is computed in order to complete the STREAMINFO 
metadata block of the created files.
This option is disabled by default because the decoding process makes the split to be
much slower (it can be twice slower).
However, even when using this option, the process remains faster compared to splitting by decoding
and then re-encoding.
<P>
<DT><B>-O TIME</B>         <DD>
<B>Overlap split files</B>. TIME will be added to each end splitpoint.
Current implementation of this option makes the split slower.
<P>
<DT><B>-o FORMAT</B>         <DD>
<B>Output format</B>. FORMAT is a string that will be used as output
directory and/or filename. If FORMAT contains the DIRCHAR character ('\' on
windows and '/' on other systems), directories will be created for each
DIRCHAR if they don't exist and the output files will be created in the
corresponding directory. If the -d option is not specified, the output directory
is the concatenation of the input file directory and the extracted path from
FORMAT. If the -d option is also specified, the output directory will be the
concatenation between the -d option value and the extracted path from the -o
FORMAT (characters up to the last DIRCHAR). Invalid filename characters from the
tags are transformed to '_'.
<P>
It can contain name variables, that must begin with @ char and that can be:
<P>
@A: performer if found, otherwise artist
<BR>

@a: artist name
<BR>

@p: performer of each song (only with .cue)
<BR>

@b: album title
<BR>

@g: genre
<BR>

@t: song title*
<BR>

@n: track number identifier* (not the real ID3 track number)**
<BR>

@N: track tag number**
<BR>

@l: track number identifier as lowercase letter* (not the real ID3 track number)**
<BR>

@L: track tag number as lowercase letter**
<BR>

@u: track number identifier as uppercase letter* (not the real ID3 track number)**
<BR>

@U: track tag number as uppercase letter**
<BR>

@f: input filename (without extension)
<BR>

@m, @s or @h: the number of minutes, seconds or hundreths of seconds of the start splitpoint**
<BR>

@M, @S or @H: the number of minutes, seconds or hundreths of seconds of the end splitpoint**
<P>
(**) One digit may follow defining the number of digits to output.
<BR>

If the digit is 0, then a special rule is applied when the pattern value is equal to 0:
<BR>

- the pattern is discarded
<BR>

- all characters like : _ . and -. preceding it are discarded
<BR>

- all characters following it are discarded up to the next @ or a separator like : _ . and -
<BR>

This rule is useful for discarding the last part of the time when equal to 0.
For example @m_@<A HREF="mailto:s_@h0hundreths__">s_@h0hundreths__</A>@M_@S will only output @m_@s__@M_@S if the hundreths of seconds are 0.
<P>
When split files are more than one, at least one of @t, @n, @N, @l, @L, @u or
@U (*) must be present to avoid ambiguous names.  You can put any prefix,
separator, suffix in the string, for more elegance.  To make easy the use
spaces in output filename without interfering with line parameters, you can use
the char '+' that will be automatically replaced with a space.  Valid examples
are:
<P>
@n_@a_@b_@t
<BR>

@a+-+@n+-+@t (default if using -c and -o is not specified)
<BR>

@a/@b/@t_@n (will create the directories '&lt;artist&gt;' and '&lt;artist&gt;/&lt;album&gt;')
<BR>

@f_@n+@m:@s+@M:@S
<P>
<DT><B>-d NAME</B>         <DD>
<B>Output directory</B>.
To put all output files in the directory named NAME. If directory does not exists,
it will be created. The -o option can also be used to output files into a
directory.
<P>
<DT><B>-n</B>         <DD>
<B>No tags</B>. Does not write ID3 or Vorbis comment in output files. Use if you need clean files.
See also the -x option.
<P>
<DT><B>-x</B>         <DD>
<B>No Xing header</B>. Does not write the Xing header in output files. Use
this option with -n if you wish to concatenate the split files and obtain
a similar file as the input file.
<P>
<DT><B>-T TAGS_VERSION</B>         <DD>
<B>Force output tags version</B>. For mp3 files, force output ID3 tags as version
ID3v1, ID3v2 or ID3v1 and ID3v2. TAGS_VERSION can be 1, 2 or 12. Default is to set the output
tags version as the tags version of the input file.
<P>
<DT><B>-C ID3V2_TEXT_ENCODING</B>         <DD>
<B>Set encoding of the ID3V2 tags</B>. For mp3 files, set the encoding of ID3V2 tags.
ID3V2_TEXT_ENCODING can be 1 for latin1 (iso-8859-1), 8 for UTF-8 or 16 for UTF-16.
Default is UTF-16.
<P>
<DT><B>-I INPUT_TAGS_ENCODING_FOR_ID3V2</B>         <DD>
<B>Set encoding of the input tags for mp3 files</B>.
INPUT_TAGS_ENCODING_FOR_ID3V2 can be 1 for latin1 (iso-8859-1), 8 for UTF-8 or 16 for UTF-16.
Default is UTF-8.
<P>
<DT><B>-N</B>         <DD>
<B>No silence log file</B>. Don't create the 'mp3splt.log' log file when using
silence detection. This option cannot be used without the '-s' option.
<P>
<DT><B>-K</B>         <DD>
<B>Keep original tags for CDDB or CUE</B>. When importing a CDDB or CUE file, set the original
input file tags and then replace them with those read from the imported file.
<P>
<DT><B>-g TAGS</B>         <DD>
<B>Custom tags</B>. Set custom tags to the split files.
If you want to set spaces in tags, you might need to double quote the whole TAGS.
TAGS should contain a list of square brackets pairs <B>[]</B>. The tags defined in the first
pair of square brackets will be set on the first split file, those defined in the
second pair of square brackets will be set on the second split file, ... Inside
a pair of square brackets, each tag is defined as <B>@variable=value</B> and
tags are <B>separated by comma</B>. If a percent sign <B>%</B> is found before
the open square bracket character, then the pair of square brackets following the % 
character will define the default tags in the following files. Multiple '%'
can be defined. An optional '<B>r</B>' character can be placed at the start, to
replace tags in tags. The 'replace tags in tags' option is not recursive. The variables can be:
<P>
@a: artist name
<BR>

@b: album title
<BR>

@t: audio title
<BR>

@y: year
<BR>

@c: comment
<BR>

@g: genre
<BR>

@n: track number (set to -2 for none)
<BR>

@o: set original tags
<BR>

@O: set exactly the same original tag bytes and discard other variables (mp3 only)
<BR>

@N: auto increment track number: 
this variable has to be placed inside the %[] field in order to have the track
number auto incremented for all the split files following it
<BR>

@m, @s or @h: the number of minutes, seconds or hundreths of seconds of the start splitpoint
<BR>

@M, @S or @H: the number of minutes, seconds or hundreths of seconds of the end splitpoint
<P>
Using the 'replace tags in tags' option, you can also use the following variables,
which are replaced by the data from the original tags: #a, #b, #t, #y, #c, #g.
Note that this will only work if @o has been found before.
<P>
Example of tags format:
<B>%[@o,@N=1,@b=special_album][@a=foo,@b=bar][@t=footitle]</B>. In this
example, the first split file will have the original tags with album
tag replaced by 'special album'; the second split file will have the tags
of the first split, with the artist tag replaced by 'foo' and the album tag
replaced by 'bar'; the third split file will have the tags of the first
split, with the title tag replaced by 'footitle'. The track number will
start at 1 for the first split file and auto increment to the other files.
<P>
Example of replacing tags in tags:
<B>r%[@o,@N=1,@b=album,@a=artist_@b_@N]</B>. Having the 'r' option, the
replace tags in tags mode is activated; thus, output artists are 'artist_album_1','artist_album_2', ...
Without the 'r' option, output artists are 'artist_@b_@N'.
<P>
Replacement is not recursive: <B>r%[@o,@N=1,@b=album_@N,@a=artist_@b]</B>
will output albums as 'album_1', 'album_2', ... but artists as 'artist_album_@N'.
<P>
Example of replacing tags in tags with # variables:
<B>r%[@o,@N=1,@t=@N_#t]</B>This will prepend the auto incremented track number to the
original input file title; supposing that the input file title is 'one_title',
this will set the titles as follows: '1_one_title', '2_one_title', ...
<P>
<DT><B>-G regex=REGEX</B>         <DD>
<B>Tags from filename regex</B>. Set tags from input filename regular expression.
REGEX can contain those variables:
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(?&lt;artist&gt;),&nbsp;(?&lt;album&gt;),&nbsp;(?&lt;title&gt;),&nbsp;(?&lt;tracknum&gt;),&nbsp;(?&lt;year&gt;),&nbsp;(?&lt;comment&gt;),&nbsp;(?&lt;genre&gt;)
<P>
Example: if the input filename is <B>artist1__album2__title3__comment4__2__2004__Samba.ogg</B>, 
<BR>

the following regular expression
<B>(?&lt;artist&gt;.*?)__(?&lt;album&gt;.*?)__(?&lt;title&gt;.*?)__(?&lt;comment&gt;.*?)__(?&lt;tracknum&gt;.*?)__(?&lt;year&gt;.*?)__(?&lt;genre&gt;.*)</B> extracts the tags:
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;(?&lt;artist&gt;):&nbsp;artist1
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;(?&lt;album&gt;):&nbsp;album2
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;(?&lt;title&gt;):&nbsp;title3
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;(?&lt;genre&gt;):&nbsp;Samba
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;(?&lt;comment&gt;):&nbsp;comment4
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;(?&lt;tracknum&gt;):&nbsp;2
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;(?&lt;year&gt;):&nbsp;2004
<P>
<DT><B>-m M3U</B>         <DD>
<B>Create .m3u file</B>. Creates a .m3u file containing the split
files. The generated .m3u file only contains the split filenames without
the path. If an output directory is specified with -d or -o, the file is
created in this directory. The path of M3U is ignored. This option cannot be
used with STDOUT output.
<P>
<DT><B>-E CUE_FILE</B>         <DD>
<B>Export to .cue file</B>. Creates a .cue file containing the splitpoints.
Use -P to export the splitpoints without actually splitting.
The cue file contains the tags of the splitpoints as comments (for example REM ALBUM, REM GENRE, REM
DATE). There is however one limitation: REM TRACK is not written if the track was auto incremented
without user defined tags.
<P>
<DT><B>-F FULL_SILENCE_LOG_FILE</B>         <DD>
<B>Export the full log of silence detection</B>. The full log filename is useful to draw the
amplitude wave of the input file (in dB) in order to choose a threshold.
<P>
<B>Note about the file structure:</B> 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-the&nbsp;first&nbsp;column&nbsp;is&nbsp;a&nbsp;dummy&nbsp;column&nbsp;which&nbsp;is&nbsp;always&nbsp;zero,&nbsp;for&nbsp;plotting&nbsp;on&nbsp;zero&nbsp;axis&nbsp;purposes
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-the&nbsp;second&nbsp;column&nbsp;is&nbsp;the&nbsp;time&nbsp;in&nbsp;seconds&nbsp;as&nbsp;double
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-the&nbsp;third&nbsp;column&nbsp;is&nbsp;the&nbsp;dB&nbsp;level
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-the&nbsp;fourth&nbsp;column&nbsp;is&nbsp;the&nbsp;silences&nbsp;shots&nbsp;counter
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-the&nbsp;five&nbsp;column&nbsp;is&nbsp;the&nbsp;number&nbsp;of&nbsp;splitpoints&nbsp;found
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-the&nbsp;sixth&nbsp;column&nbsp;is&nbsp;the&nbsp;start&nbsp;time&nbsp;of&nbsp;the&nbsp;silence&nbsp;spot&nbsp;found
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-the&nbsp;seventh&nbsp;column&nbsp;is&nbsp;the&nbsp;end&nbsp;time&nbsp;of&nbsp;the&nbsp;silence&nbsp;spot&nbsp;found
<P>
Example of plotting the full log file with gnuplot: 
<P>
gnuplot -e &quot;file='silence_logs.txt'; set decimalsign locale; set xlabel 'Time in seconds';
plot file using 2:3 title 'Threshold',
file using 2:4 title 'Silence shots' with linespoints,
file using 2:5 title 'Number of silence points found' with fsteps,
file using 6:1 title 'Begin of silence',
file using 7:1 title 'End of silence' with points;
pause -1&quot;
<P>
<DT><B>-P</B>         <DD>
<B>Pretend to split</B>. Simulation of the process without creating any
files or directories.
<P>
<DT><B>-q</B>         <DD>
<B>Quiet mode</B>. Stays quiet :) i.e. do not prompt the user for anything and print less messages.
When you use quiet option, mp3splt will try to end program without asking anything to the user (useful for scripts).
In Wrap mode it will also skip CRC check, use if you are in such a hurry.
<P>
<DT><B>-Q</B>         <DD>
<B>Very quiet mode</B>. Enables the -q option and does not print anything
to STDOUT. This option cannot be used with STDOUT output.
<P>
<DT><B>-D</B>         <DD>
<B>Debug mode</B>. Experimental debug support. Print extra informations
about what is being done. Current print doesn't have a nice format.
<P>
<DT><B>-v</B>         <DD>
<B>Print version.</B> Print the version of mp3splt and libmp3splt and exit.
<P>
<DT><B>-h</B>         <DD>
<B>Print help.</B> Print a short usage of mp3splt and exit.

<H2>EXAMPLES</H2>

<P>

<B>mp3splt album.mp3 54.32.19 67.32 -o out</B>
<BR>

<B>mp3splt album.ogg 54.32.19 67.32 -o out</B>
<P>
This is the standard use of mp3splt for constant bitrate mp3 or for any ogg.
You specify a begin time (which in this case uses hundredths, 54.32.19), an end time and an output file.
<P>

<B>mp3splt -f -d newdir album.mp3 album2.mp3 145.59  234.2</B>
<P>
This is frame mode for variable bitrate mp3 and multiple files.
You can see that time format uses min.sec even if minutes are over 60.
Output files in this case will be: album_145m_59s_0h__234m_2s_0h.mp3 and album2_145m_59s_0h__234m_2s_0h.mp3
because user didn't specify it and they will be in the directory named newdir.
<P>

<B>mp3splt  -nf album.mp3  0.12  21.34.7  25.3  30.40  38.58</B>
<P>
This is the use of -n option and multiple splitpoints. Four files will be created
and will not contain ID3 informations.
<P>

<B>mp3splt  -w  album_MP3WRAP.mp3</B>
<P>
This is Wrap mode. You can use this when mp3 is a file wrapped with Mp3Wrap or AlbumWrap.
You can specify an output directory with the -d option.
<P>
<P>

<B>mp3splt  -lq  album.mp3</B>
<P>
This is List mode. You can use this when you want to list all tracks of a wrapped file without extracting them.
With quiet option (-q), program will not calculate CRC!
<P>
<P>

<B>mp3splt -s f.mp3</B> or <B>mp3splt -s -p th=-50,nt=10 f.mp3</B>
<P>
This is silence option. Mp3splt will try to automatically detect splitpoints with silence detection and in the first case
will split all tracks found with default parameters, while in the second 10 tracks (or less if too much) with the most
probable silence points at a threshold of -50 dB.
<P>
<P>

<B>mp3splt  -c  file.cddb  album.mp3</B>
<P>
This is CDDB mode with a local file. Filenames and splitpoints will be taken from file.cddb.
<P>
<P>

<B>mp3splt  -c  query  album.mp3</B>
<P>
This is CDDB mode with internet query. Will ask you the keyword to search and you will select
the wanted cd.
<P>

<B>mp3splt  -a -c  file.cddb album.mp3</B>
<P>
This is CDDB mode with auto-adjust option (default parameters). Splitpoints will be
adjusted with silence detection in a range of 30 seconds before and after cddb splitpoints.
<P>
<P>

<B>mp3splt  -a -p gap=15,th=-23,rm -c  file.cddb album.mp3</B>
<P>
This is CDDB mode with auto-adjust option. Splitpoints will be adjusted with silence
detection in a range of 15 seconds before and after cddb splitpoints, with a threshold of -23 dB,
and silence will be removed.
<P>

<B>mp3splt  -c  query  album.mp3 -n -o @n_@t</B>
<P>
This is CDDB mode with internet query with Frame mode, NoID3 and Output format.
Output filenames will be named like: 01_Title.mp3
<P>
<P>

<B>mp3splt  -t  10.00  album.mp3</B>
<P>
This is -t option. It will split album.mp3 in many files of 10 minutes each.
