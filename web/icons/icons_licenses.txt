<citation of the first 2 questions of the license>
Q: Can I use this _____ graphic on my webpage?

A: Of course! What else do you think they are there for?

Q: Should I link to the graphic i.e. IMG
SRC="http://www.slackware.com/~msimons/slackware/grfx/shared/graphic"
or can I download it and host it on my own site?

A: By all means, you are free and welcome to download the graphic and
host it out of your own site.  Infact, that is the best idea, as
besides the fact that it won't cause us additional traffic, the
graphic is not guaranteed to stay at the same location on our site, or
even keep the same name neccessarily (although, I am striving to make
the names sensical, not repetitive, AND include SW, Slack, or
Slackware in some way; which is why some of the names are changing.
