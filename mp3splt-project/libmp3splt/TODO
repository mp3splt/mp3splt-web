*custom tags with cddb&cue&freedb
*output @a @t..@X for error mode, wrap and normal split

1) Also noticed that if the destination files already exist they are
overwritten without warning or prompting. I dont know if this was the
case with the original program as i never tested it like that. But
thats not an issue or anything, just worth remembering...so i dont
accidentally overwrite files.

2) When I split a large mp3 podcast file, I get files with
 the name track**.mp3
 Is it possible to add the name of the podcast-file
 concatenated with the track**.mp3?
 eg. A file is called gw20060212.mp3
 The splitted files: gw20060212 track01.mp3 and so on?

*mp3splt-gtk debian package must build with beep media player
*beep media player does not queue files in a correct order
*labels must not be sensitive if article not selected
*check if preferences have changed on gui exit also
*snackamp port on GTK gui
*check if the file is mp3
