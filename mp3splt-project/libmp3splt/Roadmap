_***_Libmp3splt and Mp3splt-gtk roadmap:

*Splitpoints tab:
 -put splitpoints every X time (useful for preview, instead of time
 split)
 -select which splitpoints to consider when splitting with a check
 button for each splitpoint
 -put a group column to split in a group
 -save splitpoints on exit

*Cddb & Cue tab:
 -see if we can detect FILE from .cue files and add it to the player
 tab
 -option to remove splitpoints or not when putting them in the
 splitpoints tab

*Splitted files tab:
 -save splitted files for the next session
 -keep all splitted files : make difference from one split to another
 with a date column or a coloured column
 (double click the coloured column selects all splitted files from the
 same split)
 -put a check box for each splitted file to queue or delete or remove
 from the table buttons
 -make groups for splitted files as folders on disk
 (if the splitted directory changed, remove groups and files from the
 splitted files tab)
 -drag'n'drop rows to move from one group to another

*Freedb tab:
 -option to remove splitpoints or not when putting them in the
 splitpoints tab
 -option to put artist, title automatically on the entry when we click
 on the freedb tab

*Preferences tab:
 -put option to set snackAmp port

*Other:
 -allow to put silence splitpoints in the table without splitting
 -library documentation and user manual for mp3splt-gtk
 -export splitpoints in cue or cddb files
 -make a Log tab where we put all the messages
 -save the log messages and have a history of all messages
 -put mp3 and ogg tags in splitted files
 -proxy support like mp3splt
 -rewrite mp3splt command line program by using the library with small
 functions and many comments, in order to be very flexible

_***_Some long term roadmap:
 -support for other types of files and other players
 -wrap splitted files like mp3wrap
