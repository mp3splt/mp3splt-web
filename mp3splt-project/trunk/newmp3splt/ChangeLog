# mp3splt v. 2.2.3

- the default behaviour of the tags on the split files has changed :
by default, we set the tags version of the file to split in the
split files (for example if the file for split has ID3 version X, the
tags in the split files will be ID3vX)
- added -1 (force tags in output files to be ID3v1) and -2 (force tags in
output files to be ID3v2) options
- implemented query{search_string}(chosen_result_int) for the -c option :
windows users should use this instead of -c query when searching using a
"unicode" string
- fixed all tags/filenames "unicode" encoding issues on windows
- fixed small track issue in tags
- fixed issue when the output is the same as the original file

# mp3splt v. 2.2.2

- added ID3v2 support (for known tags like title, artist, album, track
number, ...)
- added '@nX' to '-o' option to specify the number of digits (X) in the
output track identifier number
- added '-N' option for Not writing mp3splt.log file
- added the '@N' variable when using the '-g' option for auto incrementing
the track number in the tags
- created a completely new windows installer allowing to install only some
components and to uninstall only the installed files
- added some more documentation about the 'off' parameter
- updated to check for illegal characters in output filenames
- fixed bug with mp3splt not searching for plugins in its directory on
Windows (it will now search in the directory of the 'mp3splt' executable
if we detect a path from the launch command and in the installation directory
written in the registry)
- fixed the zeroes not being added before the number when using @n
- fixed small bug about '-Q' not working right

# mp3splt v. 2.2.1

- corrected the -g option to be more intuitive
- fixed bug in the man page (from wrong '-t' to wrong '-g')
- changed small usage error on '-g' option

# mp3splt v. 2.2

- mp3splt is now using libmp3splt
- checks for compatibilities between options
- added 'm-' for mp3 STDIN
- possibility to specify the server and port for freedb search;
(now using tracktype.org by default)

Examples :
query[search=cddb_cgi://tracktype.org/~cddb/cddb.cgi:80,get=cddb_cgi://tracktype.org/~
query[get=cddb_protocol://freedb.org:8880]
query[get=cddb_cgi://freedb.org/~cddb/cddb.cgi:80]

- original id3v1 for mp3 tags are kept in the split files and also
ogg vorbis tags
- add custom tags with the new '-g' option

Example of tags format :
[@a=foo,@b=bar][@t=footitle,@n=3]%[@o,@b=special_album]
In this example, the first split file will have the artist tag 'foo' and the
album tag 'bar'; the second split file will have the title tag 'footitle'
and the track number tag '3'; all the other files will have their original
tags of the file to split with the album changed to 'special_album'.

- '-o' option now creates the specified directories if '-d' option is not
specified
- added '-Q' option which enables the '-q' option and does not print
anything to STDOUT
- added experimental '-D' debug mode option
- added '-i' option for counting the number of silence splitpoints
- also added '-h' option which shows a small usage

Please read man page for more detail.

# Mp3splt v. 2.1

---------------------------------------------------------------
NOTE for people who already used mp3splt

From this version some important changes took place:

- A new option (-p) has been introduced to read
user parameters for -s and -a options, both without
arguments now. Not using -p is equivalent to use
-s auto or -a auto in the old version.

NO:  mp3splt -s auto file.mp3
YES: mp3splt -s file.mp3

NO:  mp3splt -s off=1,rm file.mp3
YES: mp3splt -s -p off=1,rm file.mp3

- Threshold parameter (th) is now in dB. It's always
a negative number between -96 dB and 0 dB.

Please read man page for more detail
---------------------------------------------------------------

- bug fixed (not exatctly a bug of mp3splt, but let's call it like this...):
  "correct" handling of misplaced Xing header of CRC-protected mp3
- feature improved: -p option introduced. Some order in the caos... ;-)
- feature improved: threshold is now in dB
- feature improved: sound level showed during silence detection
- feature improved (Thanks Marco): when using -q, no more check
  on presence of ALBW or MP3WRAP string.

---------------------------------------------------------------
NOTE for people who already used mp3splt

From this version some important changes took place:

NO:  mp3splt file.mp3 0.0 1.0 output.mp3
YES: mp3splt file.mp3 0.0 1.0 -o output.mp3

- silence option with user threshold and track number:
NO:  mp3splt -s 0.45 file.mp3 10
YES: mp3splt -s th=0.45,nt=10 file.mp3

  split from time to end of file.
- feature improved: no more [outputfile], you always have to use -o option,
  even for one single file.
- "bug" fixed: original vorbis comment preserved for all split files.
- bug fixed (Thanks Lukasz Czarniecki): now performer for cue is taken in
  account for ID3.
- bug fixed: better handling of files with Xing header. Also "bytes" field is taken

- bug fixed: missing break instruction in a switch() statement ;-)
- bug fixed: error notice if input and output files are the same file.
- bug fixed: MAXTRACKS redefined to 1000 (do you really want to split more
  than 1000 files?? ;-)

# Mp3splt v. 1.9

NOTE: From this version an important change for auto-adjust took place:
Don't use -sc any more to adjust splitpoints wiith cddb, but -a and -c:
NO:  mp3splt -sc file.cddb file.mp3

# Mp3splt v. 1.6
Not public. Experimental split of ogg files using silence detection.

# Mp3splt v. 1.5
Not public. Experimental split of mp3 files using silence detection.

# Mp3splt v. 1.4

- new important feature added: Ogg files now supported! You can split them like mp3.
- new feature added: multiple time split can be specified in command line.
- new feature added: noID3 option added. If you need clean files.
- feature improved: in cddb mode, last track has end = -1; split() now understands what to do.

- bug fixed: little bug in filename creation if file did not contain .mp3 (rare case)
- bug fixed: now handles config file open failure: standard connection without proxy.
- optimizations:
   + IMPORTANT optimization of split(), now faster using fread/fwrite instead of fgetc/fputc, with
      no len information, instead use of feof() to understand end of stream.
   + less importance to mp3file.len, only for Total time
   + IMPORTANT code clean-up: all functions are now reentrant, no more global varables, instead large
      use of state structures to fill informations on split process.
   + findhead() optimized: valid header found is saved in mp3_state, 
     no redundant call of getword() 
   + mp3splt.c source cleaned. All mp3 related functions exported to mp3.c. 
   + changed mp3info() to have similar behaviour as ogginfo().
   + improved output informations of split process. (and less intro lines...)
   + no more encoder guessing (no use). Instead channels informations (same as ogg)
   + standard ID3 title field has old filename information
   + id3option removed! I think it was useless and dirty for mp3splt. 
     Use other better programs to edit id3!
   + automatic filename creation now discards directory informations. 
     File will be created in current directory
 
# Mp3splt v. 1.3

- feature improved: added support for 2GB files, you need fseeko(). 
  (This time it's true, at least in Linux version ;)
- feature improved: Lame header supported. I don't know if will keep 
  this feature. It forces frame mode also for CBR!
- bug fixed: Xing header has now correct informations on all 
  fields (I forgot bytes field :p)
- bug fixed: now id3option is always ignored when in quiet mode.
  Even if you specify -qi
- bug fixed: check for all mp3wrap case combinations. People should 
  not put his own mp3wrap string, grr...
- bug fixed (Thanks ~WHEREamI): wrong coefficient in getid3v2(). 
  Bug would appear for ID3 bigger than 2^21 bytes.
- bug fixed: in getopt(); now -c option can specified after filename. 
  (mp3splt file.mp3 -c f.cddb)
- bug fixed: MAXSYNC redefined to 300. This should be safe also for Mp3Wrap files.
- optimizations:
  + mp3 informations optimized: Informations are printed before split 
    process starts. Total time is only
    minutes.seconds (useful when splitting). No more vbr average 
    bitrate (useless), instead
    Total time for VBR with a Xing Header printed. Sync errors printed 
    at the end of process.
  + Check on time format before starting to analyse mp3 file.
  + Added other checks for header validity.
  + Some code clean-up

# Mp3splt v. 1.2

- new feature added: now mp3splt supports .cue files! Follow the 
  instructions in man page.
- new feature added (Thanks François Revol): list option introduced for wrap mode
  Both with Mp3Wrap and AlbumWrap it only lists files without extraction.

  without any kind of user interaction.
- feature improved: VBR split files now begin with a Xing header
- feature improved (Thanks François Revol): added support of BeOS platform
- feature improved: frame mode warns about sync errors. Too many could mean a not valid mp3 file.
- feature improved: in wrap mode, now searches for mp3wrap index for 16384 bytes. This should be enough.
- feature improved: added check for "mp3wrap" string in lower case for mp3wrap file identification.
- bug fixed: ID3v2 detection is now compatible with newer versions of ID3v2 tags.
- bug fixed: wrong error notice when split failed and not in cddb mode
- bug fixed: cleanstring() added also for id.artist field
- bug fixed: added check for "Search" string len when querying CDDB. This fixed another mysterious
  bug in WIN32 version when using proxy authentication (not all Windows version).
  My fake getpass() didn't give the possibility to enter the Search keyword when querying CDDB.
- bug fixed: in WIN32 version, bug in proxy authentication due to missing mem clean
- optimizations:
   + some IMPORTANT opt. of findhead(), makehead() and mp3info(). Lot of redundant
      code cleaned. Now mp3splt is 5 time faster when it searches for a valid header.
   + now mp3splt notices file absence before querying CDDB.

# Mp3splt v. 1.1

  You can use this feature with  -c option with two possibilities:
  1) Directly contact Freedb server, search the wanted album, and get informations. (-c query)
  2) Get informations from a local cddb file. (Which must be specified after -c).
  Please read man page for more infos and for some warning about using this option.
- proxy support added
- vbr splitting improved: FPS (frame per second) calculation more 
  precise (Thanks Robert Hegemann)
- wrap option improved: now can split archive where files are wrapped 
  in subfolders
- bug fixed: now program exits when an invalid option is specified.
- bug fixed: now getword() is not invoked when file is not long enough.
- bug fixed: if begin and first valid frame were at 0, program always

	Mp3splt v. 0.6 will automatically detect wrap method between:

    +	Mp3Wrap: you can now split a mp3 file created with Mp3Wrap
	Mp3Wrap is an utility that joins two or more mp3 files
	in one large mp3, without loosing filename, and ID3
	informations. Usally mp3wrap files end with .._MP3WRAP.mp3
	With mp3splt you can now split albums in few seconds!
	Mp3Wrap is FAST, CLEAN, and of course FREE (GPL).
	You can find it at: http://mp3wrap.sourceforge.net

    +	AlbumWrap: mp3splt is compatible also with this utility, which is
	quite used on the Internet. You can split mp3 files created
	with this utility. Usually have filenames like .._ALBW.mp3
