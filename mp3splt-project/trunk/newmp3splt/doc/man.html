<h2><a name="lbAB"></a>NAME</h2>
mp3splt --- Utility for mp3 and ogg split without decoding <br>
<h2><a name="lbAD"></a>DESCRIPTION</h2>
<b>mp3splt</b> is a free command-line utility that allows you to split
mp3 and ogg files from a begin time to an end time, without need of
decoding and reencoding. It's useful to split large mp3/ogg to make
smaller files or to split entire albums to obtain original tracks.<br>
<br>
If you are splitting an album you can get splitpoints and filenames
automatically from Freedb.org server on internet or from a local .XMCD
(.CDDB) or .CUE file (see -c option), with the possibility to adjust
them automatically with silence detection (see -a option). <br>
<br>
You can also try to split files automatically with silence detection
(see -s option), or by a fixed time length (see -t option) <br>
<br>
Or if you have a file created either with Mp3Wrap or AlbumWrap, you can
easily split it just with one command (see -w option).
<div style="text-align: justify;"> <b><br>
NOTE for MP3:</b> usually mp3splt understands if mp3 is VBR by checking
the presence of a Xing or Info header and will consequently start in
framemode, but if this is not present, mp3splt will start in standard
mode. This means that splitting process will be quicker, but will be
imprecise due to variable bitrate, you can split those VBR files only
with framemode (see -f option).<br>
</div>
<h2><a name="lbAC"></a>SYNOPSIS</h2>
<b>mp3splt [OPTIONS] FILE... [BEGIN_TIME] [END_TIME...]</b>
<p style="text-align: justify;"> <b>FILE</b>: mp3 or ogg file to be
split. Note that mp3splt will recognize an ogg file instead of mp3
only from extension. So if your file is Ogg Vorbis, it must end with
".ogg". If you want to specify STDIN as input, you can use "-" when
input is mp3, and "o-" when ogg. Multiple files can be specified, all
files will be split with the same criterion. </p>
<p> <b>TIME FORMAT</b>: begin_time and end_time must be in this form: </p>
<p> <b>minutes.seconds[.hundredths]</b><br>
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
  <dd><b>minutes</b> (required): There is no limit to minutes. (You must
use this format also for minutes over 59)<br>
  </dd>
  <dd><b>seconds</b> (required): Must be between 0 and 59.<br>
  </dd>
  <dd><b>hundredths</b> (optional): Must be between 0 and 99. Use
hundredths of seconds for higher precision.</dd>
</dl>
<div style="text-align: justify;"><br>
Multiple split points can be specified. After the minimal 2, another
indefinite number of split points (up to 1000) can be specified. Each
split point will be an end time for the previous, and a begin for the
following. An invalid time format (and the next ones) will be ignored
(except for the one following filename that will be considered another
file to be split). If you want to reach the end of file, you can use
"EOF" as last splitpoint. <br>
<h2><a name="lbAE"></a>OPTIONS<br>
</h2>
<dl>
<dt style="text-align: justify;"><b>
-w</b> </dt>
  <dd style="text-align: justify;">
<b>Wrap Mode</b>. Use to split file created with:
<p><b>Mp3Wrap (<a href="http://mp3wrap.sourceforge.net">http://mp3wrap.sourceforge.net</a>)</b>:
This tool joins two or more mp3 files in one large playable file that
usually contains the string MP3WRAP in filename and a special comment in
ID3v2. If the file you are splitting is a Mp3Wrap file the splitting
process will be very fast and you will obtain all files just with one
command. If your filename contains MP3WRAP and you have errors or you
don't want to use wrap mode, just remove it from filename.</p>
    <p> <b>AlbumWrap</b>: mp3splt is compatible also with albumwrap
files, which usually contain the string ALBW in filename and ID3v2
contains AlbumWrap. But, as AlbumWrap extractor, mp3splt doesn't give
any warranty.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt style="text-align: justify;"><b>
-l</b> </dt>
  <dd style="text-align: justify;"> <b>List mode</b> (Only for Wrap
mode). Lists all tracks wrapped in a Mp3Wrap or AlbumWrap archive
without any extraction. Use this to view only the content of the file or
to test if file is a valid wrapped file.</dd>
  <dt style="text-align: justify;"><b><br>
-e</b> </dt>
  <dd style="text-align: justify;"> <b>Error mode</b> (mp3 only). It is
useful to split large file derivated from a concatenation of smaller
files. It detects split points from the so called "sync errors" (data
that break stream, such as ID3 or junk data). Examples of applicable
files are wrapped files (both AlbumWrap and Mp3Wrap) or files created by
appending many mp3 files together. So, when you have a file to split,
you should always try to use this option.</dd>
  <dt style="text-align: justify;"><b><br>
-t TIME</b> </dt>
  <dd style="text-align: justify;"> <b>Time mode</b>. This option will
create an indefinite number of smaller files with a fixed time length
specified by TIME (which has the same format described above). It is
useful to split long files into smaller (for example with the time
length of a CD). Adjust option (-a) can be used to adjust splitpoints
with silence detection.</dd>
  <dt style="text-align: justify;"><b><br>
-s</b> </dt>
  <dd style="text-align: justify;"> <b>Silence mode</b>. To split with
silence detection. When you use -s option, mp3splt attempts to detect
silence points in all the file (or just in some parts, see -a and -c
below for this). To detect silence we need to decode files, so this
option can be really slow if used with big files. It accepts some
parameters with -p option (see below for a detailed description): <i>threshold
level</i> (th) which is the sound level to be considered silence, <i>number
of tracks</i> (nt) which is the desired number of tracks, <i>cutpoint
offset</i> (off) which is the offset of cutpoint in silence, <i>minimum
length</i> (min) which is the minimum silence length in seconds, <i>remove
silence</i> (rm) which allows you to remove the silence between split
tracks. If you don't specify any parameter, mp3splt will use the default
values. Of course if you specify the number of tracks to
split, you will help mp3splt to understand which are the most probable
split points, anyway once you scan a file with -s option, mp3splt will
write a file named "mp3splt.log" in which it saves all silence points
found. This allows you to run mp3splt with different parameters (except
th and min) without need of decoding file again. Finally, if the number
of silence points is not correct, you have many chances to achieve right
result. For example if a silence point was not detected because too
short, you can manually split the long track in the two smaller ones. Or
if file is an MP3 (not with ogg) and there are too many silence points
that can't be discarded reducing track number (because are longer than
right points) you can safely concatenate them with 'cat' programs or
similar ('copy /b file1+file2' for dos) because split files are
consecutive, no data is lost and no ID3 is written for this purpose.
This option is intended to split small/medium size (but even large if
you can wait ;)  mp3 and ogg files where tracks are separated by a
reasonable silence time. To try to split mixed albums or files with
consecutive tracks (such as live performances) might be only a waste of
time.</dd>
  <dt style="text-align: justify;"><b><br>
-c SOURCE</b> </dt>
  <dd style="text-align: justify;"> <b>CDDB mode</b>. To get
splitpoints and filenames automatically from SOURCE, that is the name of
a ".cue" file (note that it must end with ".cue", otherwise it will be
wrongly interpreted as a cddb file) or a local .XMCD (.CDDB) file on
your hard disk. If you want to get informations from Internet, just type
"query" instead of filename. mp3splt will connect to server, will ask
you some keywords and will start to find the requested informations. If
you will find the right album, then mp3splt will finally query the
server to get the selected album and, if all is correct, will write a
file named "query.cddb" from which will get splitpoints and filenames.
ID3v1 will be created automatically with taken informations. The first
time you run mp3splt with "query" option, it will ask you if you use a
proxy, just fill out informations.</dd>
  <dd><br>
  </dd>
  <dd><b>IMPORTANT NOTE FOR CDDB</b>: File split with this option
might be not very precise due to: <br>
  </dd>
  <dd> 1) Who extracts CD tracks may use "Remove silence" option. This
means that the large file is shorter than CD Total time. Never use this
option. <br>
2) Who burns CD may add extra pause seconds between tracks. Never do
it. <br>
3) Encoders may add some padding frames so that file is longer than CD. <br>
4) There are several entries of the same cd on CDDB. In mp3splt they
appears with "\=&gt;" symbol. Try some of them and find the best for
yours, usually you can find the correct splitpoints for your mp3, so
good luck! </dd>
  <dd><br>
  </dd>
  <dd><b>YOU CAN USE -a OPTION TO ADJUST SPLITPOINTS! (see below)</b><br>
  </dd>
  <dt style="text-align: justify;"><b><br>
-a</b> </dt>
  <dd style="text-align: justify;"> <b>Auto-adjust mode</b>. This
option uses silence detection to auto-adjust splitpoints. It can be used
in standard mode, or with -t and -c option (of course if there is
silence in the file ;). It accepts some parameters with -p option (see
below for a detailed description): <i>threshold level</i> (th)
which is the sound level to be considered silence, <i>cutpoint offset</i>
(off) which is the offset of cutpoint in silence, <i>gap</i> (gap) which
is the gap value around splitpoint to search for silence. If you don't
specify any parameter, mp3splt will use the default values. With -a
option splitting process is the same, but for each splitpoint mp3splt
will decode some time (gap) before and some after to find silence and
adjust splitpoints.</dd>
  <dt style="text-align: justify;"><b><br>
    </b></dt>
  <dt style="text-align: justify;"> <b>-p PARAMETERS</b> </dt>
  <dd style="text-align: justify;"> <b>Parameters for -a and -s option</b>.
When using -a and -s option some users parameters can be specified in
the argument and must be in the form:<br>
    <br>
    <b>&lt;name1=value,name2=value,...&gt;<br>
    <br>
    </b> You can specify an indefinite number of them, with no spaces
and separated by comma. Available parameters are:
    <p> <b>Both -s and -a:</b> </p>
    <ul>
      <li> <b>th=FLOAT</b> (negative): threshold level (dB) to be
considered silence. It is a float number between -96 and 0. Default is
-48 dB, which is a value found by tests and should be good in most
cases. </li>
      <li> <b>off=FLOAT</b> (between -2 and 2): offset of splitpoint. it
allows you to adjust the offset of cutpoint in silence time. 0 is the
begin of silence, and 1 the end. Default is 0.8.</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <b>Only -s</b>
    <ul>
      <li> <b>nt=INTEGER</b> (positive): number of tracks to be split
when using -s option. By default all tracks are split. </li>
      <li> <b>min=FLOAT</b> (positive): minimum number of seconds to be
considered a valid splitpoint. All silences shorter than min are
discarded. </li>
      <li> <b>rm</b>: does not require an additional number and it used
to remove silence when using -s option.</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <b>Only -a</b>
    <ul>
      <li> <b>gap=INTEGER</b> (positive): time to decode before and
after splitpoint, increase if splitpoints are completely wrong, or
decrease if wrong for only few seconds. Of course the smaller the gap,
the faster the process. Default gap is 30 seconds (so for each song,
total decode time is one minute). </li>
    </ul>
  </dd>
    <br>
    <dt style="text-align: justify;"><b>-f</b> </dt>
    <dd style="text-align: justify;"> <b>Frame mode (mp3 only)</b>.
Process all frames, seeking split positions by counting frames and not
with bitrate guessing. In this mode you have higher precision and you
can split variable bitrate mp3. (You can also split costant bitrate mp3,
but it will take more time). Note also that "high" precision means that
time seeking is reliable, but may not coincide for example with another
player program that uses time seeking with bitrate guessing, so make
your choice. Frame mode will print extra info on split process, such as
sync errors. If you obtain some sync errors, try also to split with -e
option.</dd>
    <dt style="text-align: justify;"><b><br>
-k</b> </dt>
    <dd style="text-align: justify;"> <b>Input not seekable</b>.
Consider input not seekable (default when using STDIN as input). This
allows you to split mp3 and ogg streams which can be read only one time
and can't be seeked. Both framemode and standard mode are available, but
framemode can be really slow if used with big files, because to seek
splitpoints we need to process all bytes and all frames. -k option (so
STDIN as input too) can't be used together with -s -a -w- e, because
input must be seekable for those options.</dd>
    <dt><b><br>
-o FORMAT</b> </dt>
    <dd> <b>Output format</b>, to specify an output filename. FORMAT is
a string that will be used as output filename. When using -c option, it
can contain name variables, that must begin with @ char and that can be: <br>
      <br>
      <b>@a</b>: artist name<br>
      <b>@p</b>: performer of each song (only with .cue)<br>
      <b>@b</b>: album title<br>
      <b>@t</b>: song title*<br>
      <b>@n</b>: track number*  (valid also when not using -c)<br>
      <br>
When split files are more than one, at least one between @t and @n
(*) must be present to avoid ambiguous names. You can put any prefix,
separator, suffix in the string, for more elegance. To make easy the use
spaces in output filename without interfering with line parameters, you
can use the char '+' that will be automatically replaced with a space.
Valid examples are: <br>
      <br>
@n_@a_@b_@t<br>
@a+-+@n+-+@t (default if using -c and -o is not specified)<br>
    </dd>
    <dt style="text-align: justify;"><b><br>
-d NAME</b> </dt>
    <dd style="text-align: justify;"> <b>Output directory</b>. To put
all output files in the directory named NAME. If directory does not
exists, it will be created.</dd>
    <dt><b><br>
-n</b> </dt>
    <dd> <b>No Tag</b>. Does not write ID3 or Vorbis comment in
outputfile. Use if you need clean files.</dd>
    <dt style="text-align: justify;"><b><br>
-q</b> </dt>
    <dd style="text-align: justify;"> <b>Quiet mode</b>. Stays quiet :)
i.e. do not prompt the user for anything and print less messages. When
you use quiet option, mp3splt will try to end program without asking
anything to the user (useful for scripts). In Wrap mode it will also
skip CRC check, use if you are in such a hurry. </dd>
  </dl>
  <h2><a name="lbAF"></a>EXAMPLES</h2>
  <b>mp3splt album.mp3 54.32.19 67.32 -o out.mp3</b><br>
  <b>mp3splt album.ogg 54.32.19 67.32 -o out.ogg</b>
  <p> This is the standard use of mp3splt for constant bitrate mp3 or
for any ogg. You specify a begin time (which in this case uses
hundredths, 54.32.19), an end time and an output file. </p>
  <p> <b>mp3splt  -f -d newdir album.mp3 album2.mp3 145.59  234.2</b> </p>
  <p> This is frame mode for variable bitrate mp3 and multiple files.
You can see that time format uses min.sec even if minutes are over 60.
Output files in this case will be: album_145.59_234.2.mp3 and
album2_145.59_234.2.mp3 because user didn't specify it and they will be
in the directory named newdir. </p>
  <p> <b>mp3splt  -nf  album.mp3  0.12  21.34.7  25.3  30.40  EOF</b> </p>
  <p> This is the use of -n option and multiple splitpoints. Four files
will be created that will not contain ID3 informations. EOF stands for
end of file. </p>
  <p> <b>mp3splt  -w  album_MP3WRAP.mp3</b> </p>
  <p> This is Wrap mode. You can use this when mp3 is a file wrapped
with Mp3Wrap or AlbumWrap. You have not to specify further arguments
because all will be automatic. </p>
  <p> <b>mp3splt  -wlq  album_MP3WRAP.mp3</b> or just <b>mp3splt  -lq
album_MP3WRAP.mp3</b> </p>
  <p> This is List mode. You can use this when you want to list all
tracks of a wrapped file without extracting them. With quiet option
(-q), program will not calculate CRC! </p>
  <p> <b>mp3splt  -s album.mp3</b> or <b>mp3splt  -s -p th=-50,nt=10
album.mp3</b> </p>
  <p> This is silence option. Mp3splt will try to automatically detect
splitpoints with silence detection and in the first case will split all
tracks found with default parameters, while in the second 10 tracks (or
less if too much) with the most probable silence points at a threshold
of -50 dB.<br>
  </p>
  <p> <b>mp3splt  -c  file.cddb  album.mp3</b> </p>
  <p> This is CDDB mode with a local file. Filenames and splitpoints
will be taken from file.cddb. </p>
  <p> <b>mp3splt  -c  query  album.mp3</b> </p>
  <p> This is CDDB mode with internet query. Will ask you the keyword to
search and you will select the wanted cd. </p>
  <p> <b>mp3splt  -a  -c  file.cddb album.mp3</b> </p>
  <p> This is CDDB mode with auto-adjust option (default parameters).
Splitpoints will be adjusted with silence detection in a range of 30
seconds before and after cddb splitpoints. </p>
  <p> <b>mp3splt  -a -p gap=15,th=-23,rm  -c  file.cddb album.mp3</b> </p>
  <p> This is CDDB mode with auto-adjust option. Splitpoints will be
adjusted with silence detection in a range of 15 seconds before and
after cddb splitpoints, with a threshold of -23 dB, and silence will be
removed. </p>
  <p> <b>mp3splt  -c  query  album.mp3 -n -o @n_@t</b> </p>
  <p> This is CDDB mode with internet query with Frame mode, NoID3 and
Output format. Output filenames will be named like: 01_Title.mp3 </p>
  <p> <b>mp3splt  -t  10.00  album.mp3</b> </p>
  <p> This is -t option. It will split album.mp3 in many files of 10
minutes each. </p>
