_***_Libmp3splt and Mp3splt-gtk roadmap:

*Splitpoints tab:
 -put splitpoints every X time (useful for preview, instead of time split)
 -put a group column to split in a group
 -save splitpoints on exit

*Cddb & Cue tab:
 -see if we can detect FILE from .cue files and add it to the player tab
 -option to remove splitpoints or not when putting them in the splitpoints tab

*Split files tab:
 -save split files for the next session
 -keep all split files : make difference from one split to another
 with a date column or a coloured column
 (double click the coloured column selects all split files from the same split)
 -make groups for split files as folders on disk
 (if the split directory changed, remove groups and files from the
 split files tab)
 -drag'n'drop rows to move from one group to another

*Freedb tab:
 -option to remove splitpoints or not when putting them in the
 splitpoints tab
 -option to put artist, title automatically on the entry when we click
 on the freedb tab

*Other:
 -library documentation and user manual for mp3splt-gtk
 -export splitpoints in cue files
